Rattlesnake Model

A hi-def voxelized model of a rattlesnake, with 7 animations (listed below)

Warning: This model may be too large for some people's preferences. (21,598 kb)


This can be used for any mob for minetest, just put the image in the textures folder, and the .b3d file in the models folder. 
You will have to play around with the size and the selection box from within the code, as well as the proper speed of each animation.
However, all the modelling and animation has been done for you. The rest animations and the strike animations definately need different speeds.
